# Advent Of Code 2019
This project includes solutions for most of the [AdventOfCode 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) challenges.

All of the projects are built in C# using the dotnet core runtime.
Note: Until day 8 i didn't know what LINQ was, our how to use it. 
Now that i do, i highly recommend using it, since it makes processing collections and other stuff way easier.
