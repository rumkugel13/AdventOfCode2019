# AdventOfCode2019
This project includes solutions for most of the Advent of Code 2019 challenges.
Check it out at [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

All of the projects are built in C# using the dotnet core runtime.
Note: Until day 8 i didn't know what LINQ was, our how to use it. 
Now that i do, i highly recommend using it, since it makes processing collections and other stuff way easier.
